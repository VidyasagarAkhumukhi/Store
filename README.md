## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up several services and create an environment file.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. This file is crucial for storing sensitive keys and API credentials securely.

```env
# Prisma / Supabase
# Go to Project Settings > Database > Connection string in Supabase
# Use the URI for both, but add "?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1" to DATABASE_URL for connection pooling

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Supabase Storage
# Go to Project Settings > API in Supabase
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Clerk Authentication
# Get keys from your Clerk application dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
# Sign up in your app, then find your user ID in the Clerk dashboard to set this
ADMIN_USER_ID=

# Stripe Payments
# Get keys from your Stripe developer dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# Other
# Your local development URL or deployed site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Important:** Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your secret keys to a public repository.

### 4. Prisma Setup

Push the schema to your Supabase database:

This command reads your `schema.prisma` file and syncs it with your database, creating the necessary tables and columns.

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

(Optional) Seed the database with initial product data:

If you have a `prisma/seed.js` and `prisma/products.json`, run this command to populate your database with sample products.

```bash
node prisma/seed.js
```

You can also use `npx prisma studio` to open a local GUI to view and manage your database directly.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üí° Technical Highlights

- **Next.js App Router:** Leverages the latest Next.js features for a robust, server-centric architecture. Server Components are used extensively for data fetching, which reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, leading to faster initial page loads.
- **Server Actions:** Data mutations (like creating products, adding to cart, or submitting reviews) are handled securely on the server using Server Actions. This simplifies the architecture by co-locating data mutations with the components that use them, often eliminating the need for separate API routes.
- **Prisma & Supabase:** This combination provides a powerful and type-safe database layer. Prisma's auto-generated client and migration tools streamline database development, while Supabase offers a scalable, hassle-free PostgreSQL backend and file storage solution.
- **Clerk Authentication:** Simplifies user management with pre-built UI components and secure backend SDKs. The middleware efficiently protects routes and manages user sessions across the application.
- **Stripe Payments:** The integration uses a server-side approach where a clientSecret is generated for each transaction. This secret is then passed to the frontend, ensuring a secure payment flow with Stripe's Embedded Checkout, which is fully PCI-compliant.
- **shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS:** A modern approach to styling that combines the power of a utility-first CSS framework with beautifully designed, accessible, and fully customizable components, allowing for rapid and consistent UI development.
